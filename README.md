## Shape Garden
[Glitch Link]()   
I did the SVG Topic
I used the original [W3 Schools SVG](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp) and [W3 Schools SVG Scripting](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_scripting.asp) tutorials that were linked but did not use the last one.
This program was originally built off of the first W3 Schools SVG tutorial, but that consisted of only like 3 lines of code so I am more inclined to say that this code is more original.
This program is just a collection of shapes that all have gradient colors with the star shape able to grow and shrink at random (between a factor of 0.5 to 2) when pressing the "Random Size" button and the hexagon moving in a circle across the webpage.
